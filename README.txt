Invaders.

In this classic arcade game, alien invaders are trying to destroy the planet. You must dodge their shots and kill them before they get past you.

The player must fight through 3 waves of these aliens. They will move from left to right, going down a bit and reversing directions if they're within 100 pixels of the edge.

The player moves left and right with the Left/Right arrow keys, and fires shots with the Space key. The player can hit the Q key at anytime to quit.
