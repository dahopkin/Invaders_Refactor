Invaders version 2.

In this classic arcade game, alien invaders are trying to destroy the planet. You must dodge their shots and kill them before they get past you.

You must fight through 3 waves of these aliens. They will move from left to right, going down a bit and reversing directions if they're within 100 pixels of the edge. However, there will also be a purple mothership that appears and floats by independent of the other invaders. Shoot it, and you get 250 points, which is worth almost two whole columns of regular invaders. 

You move left and right with the Left/Right arrow keys, and fire shots with the Space key. There will be green shields you can hide behind, though the individual blocks behind them expire after a shot from either an invader or yourself. Be careful with your shots. Rack up 1,000 points, and you get a bomb. Use the B key to fire this orb at the wave of invaders. It expands upon impact, taking out multiple invaders. Better yet, it goes through shields, so you don't have to worry about destroying a shield or wasting your shot. The bomb is extremely powerful, so make sure you kill that mothership when it appears.

The player can hit the Q key at anytime to quit.
